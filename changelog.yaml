    description: "Major restructure: hierarchical directory structure with individual model files"
    changes:
      breaking:
        - Migrated from flat files (models.yaml, providers.yaml) to hierarchical structure
        - Each provider now has its own directory under providers/
        - Each model has its own YAML file under providers/{name}/models/
        - Added manifest.yaml for remote sync
        - Added per-provider categories.yaml and templates.yaml
      new_features:
        - Atomic model updates (one file per model)
        - Better git history isolation
        - Easier community contributions
        - Manifest-based remote sync for efficiency
      backward_compatibility:
        - Legacy flat files still supported as fallback
        - Loader automatically detects and uses appropriate format
